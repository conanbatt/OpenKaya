  # Double Elimination constraints/rules
  #- P0 only live players (lost only one time max) - tournament finishes when only one player remains
  #- P1 players shouldn't play each other again unless there is no choice
  #- P2 top players (by score) should play together if possible
  #- P3 odd number of players the last one to be picked gets a win by default
  #- P4 add a bit of randomness so that the order of entry of the player has no influence
    
  # TODO
  
  # - Handle handicap tournaments
  # - Implement Time Limits
  # - Handle special external commands (bye, sleep...)
