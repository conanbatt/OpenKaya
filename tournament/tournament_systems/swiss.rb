  # Rules of swiss tournament implemented here (loosely based on FIDE definition)
  
  #1.   The number of rounds to be played is declared beforehand. [ENFORCED]
  #2.   Two players may play each other only once. [ENFORCED]
  #3.   Players are paired with others of the same score, or nearest score. [ENFORCED]
  #4.   When possible, a player is given the white pieces as many times as he is given the black pieces. [NOT ENFORCED]
  #5.   When possible, a player is given the colour other than that he was given the previous round. [NOT ENFORCED]
  #6.   The final ranking order is determined by the aggregate of points won: 1 point for a win, 0.5 points for a draw and 0 point for a loss. A player whose opponent fails to appear for a scheduled game receives one point. [ENFORCED]
  #7.   Tie breaking is determined by SOS [ENFORCED]
  
  # TODO
  
  # - No handling of handicap
  # - Implement Time Limits
  # - Handle special external commands (bye, sleep...)
